\section{introduction}
Tuition is a sum of money charged for receiving education from educational instituitions. The tuition is given by multiplication of the amount of money per one credit (one hour) and the numbers of credits that students take. Usually, students take 15 credits in one semester. Given the fact, my project assumed that the transition of the cost is based on 15 hours in one semester. Moreover, fees are costs for students to receive any kind of service in universities such as academic regestration, technology, library fees, and so on.The cost ofthe fees is also given by multiplication of the number of the classes that students take and the amount of each fee per one credit.
